          <p>
            People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported â€“
            ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear
            2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to
            severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fever or chills</li>
            <li>Cough</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
            <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
            <li>Diarrhea</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue
            to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults
            and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart
            or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing
            more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
